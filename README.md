# Computer Science Portfolio
CS499 Capstone Project

## Introduction
My name is Julie Pew and I have been striving for growth and success throughout my time as a computer science major. This portfolio is the final for my capstone in CS 499 at Southern New Hampshire University which aims to prove my skill in software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and databases. I consider myself a hard-working individual who is adaptable, resilient, and has a fine attention to detail and problem solving. Let this portfolio be proof of my skill and success. 

## Self Assessment
The development of my final artifact and this portfolio has taught me valuable skills about what it means to be a critical member of a team. Having set deadlines let my time-efficiency shine as I was managing the work load and submitting my deliverables in a timely manner. Being able to meet deadlines is a necessary part of working with a team especially when others are dependent on you. Another way that I showed exceptional team-oriented skills is through clear comments within my code that explain the purpose of each part. This is to ensure proper labeling and allow others to easily follow along and understand the code. Attention to detail is what makes my code clean, error free, and professionally written so that there are no spelling errors or unclear explanations. 

On the programming side of the work, I used industry standard practices and presented my growth and knowledge of programming throughout my artifact. Each enhancement is proof of my understanding in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Starting with the conversion into an MVVM architecture, I then moved into including a HashMap, and finished off with the implementation of Room DB. These enhancements show my strength in programming and computer science. The separation of concerns and efficiency of my app are clear with the strategies I employed and prove my value to a team of like-minded professionals. 

I am someone that can learn on the fly and adapts easily to change. Due to that fact, I would make a great addition to any team as I will be able to blend in and fit the role required of me. Bringing along the skills I have honed and learned over the courses of the computer science program, I can add new ideas and fresh solutions to any problem. The Inventory App is functional, useful, and has an appealing UI that expresses my overall care to user satisfaction. 

## Project Overview
**Chosen Artifact: Inventory Management App**\
The point was to make three enhancements to one or multiple artifacts, so I chose a single artifact that would satisfy all three categories of enhancement. The artifact I chose for all three enhancements is the Inventory Management App from CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This app was originally created in the May-June term of 2025 within Android Studio. The three enhancements along with their categories are listed below:

- Software design and engineering
    - To prove my proficiency in this category I decided to implement a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to my app. This allowed me to maintain proper separation of concerns as well as clean code. 
- Algorithms and data structure
    - Introducing a HashMap into my code satisfies the expected outcome and proficiency in algorithms and data structure. It was used for the login of my app to cache the login.
- Databases
    - A benefit to using Android Studio is having access to built-in features such as Room DB which is a library that works as a layer over SQLite. Switching to Room DB allowed me to maintain best coding practices through separation of concerns and organized code. 

## Code Review
This code review provides a walk-through of my original artifact and details the ways in which I planned to make each enhancement. Additionally, I took that opportunity to acknowledge the preexisting errors and warnings within my code. [Click here for the code review!](https://youtu.be/mkwruYMQmUM)

## Enhancement One
#### MVVM Architecture
The first enhancement made to my Inventory Management App is the reconstruction into a Model-View-ViewModel architecture. The reason I chose the Inventory App for this enhancement is because I felt unsatisfied with my initial completion of the app. I wanted another chance to prove my mobile programming skills. Originally there was no solid architecture which meant I had no separation of concerns(SoC). UI and business logic was all embedded within each other which meant testing was difficult. Implementing the MVVM architecture allowed SoC and meant I could uphold best industry practices within my code. Including this change also laid the groundwork for the next enhancements. 

I believe I have met course outcomes such as:
- Demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications

Some challenges that I faced when completing this enhancement was rewriting the necessary code to fit the new architecture and ensure that my UI was separate from business logic. I was also tasked with addressing preexisting errors within the code as well as clearing any warnings that were present. Creating new files that fit the MVVM structure was simple and helped me stay on track since my file tree became significantly more organized. My work was cut out for me with the completion of this enhancement and I was able to smoothly move into the next task.

## Enhancement Two
#### HashMap
In order to show my strength in algorithms and data structure I adapted my code to include a HashMap that caches logins. I wanted to test myself with this enhancement and chose a HashMap as the way to do it. There were a few ways that I could have implemented one into my app, but I chose to go the Login route which allows for fast and efficient validation without having to repeatedly query the database. With this change I feel as though I proved my ability to adapt and find new solutions. 

Some course outcomes that I met include:
- Demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications
- Develop a security mindset in software architecture
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a problem while managing the trade-offs

A challenge I faced while adding the HashMap to my code was making sure I maintained functionality of my code. It took some researching and learning to figure out the ins and outs of HashMaps and how one could be useful in my app. Along the way I ran into several errors that I was having to fix as I went which is par for the course when programming. Through determination and the motivation to finish strong, I was able to focus and work through the challenges that I was encountering. 

## Enhancement Three
#### Room DB
Switching to the built-in library of Room DB in Android Studio was a smart move and significantly elevated my app. The original artifact used SQLite and had UI and business logic embedded within each other which was not in line with best practices. Using Room DB as an abstraction layer over top of SQLite provides simplified database operations, improved performance, and compile-time verification which reduces errors. Having done the work to separate files out during the MVVM enhancement, I already prepped files for Entity classes and DAO classes and was able to smoothly transition into coding. 

This final enhancement was the final piece to complete all of the course outcomes as follows:
- Demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications
- Develop a security mindset in software architecture
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a problem while managing the trade-offs
- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments

The code I added to my app is well written, maintains best industry practices, and has clear commenting which explains the use of each part. These aspects are what make my final artifact a great example for the completion of the course outcomes. However, this did not happen without challenges. During my time implementing Room DB, I was spending lots of time researching and learning about Room DB and the annotations that go along with it. I took the challenges in stride and worked through them one by one until I successfully reached my goal of a well polished Inventory App that meets the requirements. 

## Summary 
This portfolio serves as a representation of my dedication to honing my skills in computer science and programming. It is the culmination of everything I have learned during my academic career at Southern New Hampshire University and will continue to be a milestone in the future as I advance my skills. It has proved my proficiency in programming and app development and furthermore is a token of my personal skills in staying on task, being time-efficient, and detail-oriented.

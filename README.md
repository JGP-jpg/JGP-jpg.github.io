# Computer Science Portfolio
CS499 Capstone Project

## Introduction
My name is Julie Pew and I have been striving for growth and success throughout my time as a computer science major. This portfolio is the final for my capstone in CS 499 at Southern New Hampshire University which aims to prove my skill in software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and databases. I consider myself a hard-working individual who is adaptable, resilient, and has a fine attention to detail and problem solving. Let this portfolio be proof of my skill and success.

## Project Overview
**Chosen Artifact: Inventory Management App**\
The point was to make three enhancements to at least one artifact or three separate artifacts. I chose to enhance a single artifact being the CS360 final, an inventory management app. This app had potential and since I wanted to fully flesh it out anyway, I decided to select it as the artifact to enhance in all three categories. 

- Software design and engineering
    - To prove my proficiency in this category I decided to implement a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to my app. This allowed me to maintain proper separation of concerns as well as clean code. 
- Algorithms and data structure
    - Introducing a HashMap into my code satisfies the expected outcome and proficiency in algorithms and data structure. It was used for the login of my app to cache the login.
- Databases
    - A benefit to using Android Studio is having access to built-in features such as Room DB which is a library that works as a layer over SQLite. Swithcing to Room DB allowed me to maintain best coding practices through separation of concerns and organized code. 

## Code Review
This code review provides a walk-through of my original artifact and details the ways in which I planned to make each enhancement. Additionally, I took that opportunity to acknowledge the preexisting errors and warnings within my code. 

## Enhancement One
#### MVVM Architecture
The first enhancement made to my Inventory Management App is the reconstruction into a Model-View-ViewModel architecture. 

## Enhancement Two
#### HashMap
In order to show my strength in algorithms and data structure I adapted my code to include a HashMap that caches logins. 

## Enhancement Three
#### Room DB
Switching to the built-in library of Room DB in Android Studio was a smart move and significantly elevated my app.

# Computer Science Portfolio
CS499 Capstone Project

## Introduction
My name is Julie Pew and I have been striving for growth and success throughout my time as a computer science major. This portfolio is the final for my capstone in CS 499 at Southern New Hampshire University which aims to prove my skill in software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and databases. I consider myself a hard-working individual who is adaptable, resilient, and has a fine attention to detail and problem solving. Let this portfolio be proof of my skill and success.

## Project Overview
**Chosen Artifact: Inventory Management App**\
The point was to make three enhancements to one or multiple artifacts, so I chose a single artifact that would satisfy all three categories of enhancement. The artifact I chose for all three enhancements is the Inventory Management App from CS360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This app was originally created in the May-June term of 2025 within Android Studio. The three enhancements along with their categories are listed below:

- Software design and engineering
    - To prove my proficiency in this category I decided to implement a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to my app. This allowed me to maintain proper separation of concerns as well as clean code. 
- Algorithms and data structure
    - Introducing a HashMap into my code satisfies the expected outcome and proficiency in algorithms and data structure. It was used for the login of my app to cache the login.
- Databases
    - A benefit to using Android Studio is having access to built-in features such as Room DB which is a library that works as a layer over SQLite. Swithcing to Room DB allowed me to maintain best coding practices through separation of concerns and organized code. 

## Code Review
This code review provides a walk-through of my original artifact and details the ways in which I planned to make each enhancement. Additionally, I took that opportunity to acknowledge the preexisting errors and warnings within my code. 

## Enhancement One
#### MVVM Architecture
The first enhancement made to my Inventory Management App is the reconstruction into a Model-View-ViewModel architecture. The reason I chose the Inventory App for this enhancement is because I felt unsatisfied with my initial completion of the app. I wanted another chance to prove my mobile programming skills. Originally there was no solid architecture which meant I had no separation of concerns(SoC). UI and business logic was all embedded within each other which meant testing was difficult. Implementing the MVVM architecture allowed SoC and meant I could uphold best industry practices within my code. Including this change also laid the groundwork for the next enhancments. 

I believe I have met course outcomes such as:
- Demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications

Some challenges that I faced when completing this enhancement was rewriting the necessary code to fit the new architecture and ensure that my UI was separate from business logic. I was also tasked with addressing preexisting errors within the code as well as clearing any warnings that were present. Creating new files that fit the MVVM structure was simple and helped me stay on track since my file tree became significantly more organized. My work was cut out for me with the completion of this enhancement and I was able to smoothly move into the next task.

## Enhancement Two
#### HashMap
In order to show my strength in algorithms and data structure I adapted my code to include a HashMap that caches logins. I wanted to test myself with this enhancement and chose a HashMap as the way to do it. There were a few ways that I could have implemented one into my app, but I chose to go the Login route which allows for fast and efficient validation without having to repeatedly query the database. With this change I feel as though I proved my ability to adapt and find new solutions. 

Some course outcomes that I met include:
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications
- Demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques
- Develop a security mindset in software architecture
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a problem while managing the trade-offs

A challenge I faced while adding the HashMap to my code was making sure I maintained functionality of my code. It took some researching and learning to figure out the ins and outs of HashMaps and how one could be useful in my app. 

## Enhancement Three
#### Room DB
Switching to the built-in library of Room DB in Android Studio was a smart move and significantly elevated my app.
